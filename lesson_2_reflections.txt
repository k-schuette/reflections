What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you
need to do it?
Initializing a repository tells git that there is a
project you're going to start tracking. It needs to be
done in order to create the space for the project.

How is the staging area different from the working
directory and the repository? What value do you think
it offers?
The staging area is an in-between step between the
working directory and the repository. The value is
that it allows an area to check that you are doing
what you intend to do before creating a commit.

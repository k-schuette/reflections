When would you want to use a remote repository rather than
keeping all your work local?
Remote repositories allow work from another computer,
whether by a collaborator or the by repository creator.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your
remote repository?
You would want to wait and pull changes manually if you were
working on a separate branch of the project. Also the
internet connection might be weak or unsecured, so it would
be better to wait.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?
Branch: Offshoot of master branch. Used to experiment with
new features that may or may not work and/or be
incorporated into the master branch.
Clone: Copy of a repository on a local host.
Fork: Special type of clone on GitHub. Changes to a fork
do not change the original repository, but GitHub
maintains a link that shows which account originally
created the repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known
state of the remote stored locally?
With a copy of the last known state of the remote stored
locally, the user can keep track of when versions may have
diverged, and has a base to refer to when collaborating on
a project. Also, if the user is going to be working offline,
he or she can compare differences on the local machine
without having to merge right away.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What
would be easier, and what would be harder?
Without Git or GitHub, you would have to email files back and
forth, or save them in a shared space like Google Drive or
Dropbox.
This would be easier since the shared folders are more widely
accessible than GitHub, and there is no learning curve.
This would be harder because GitHub has strong tools for
tracking changes and for sharing pinpointed comments. In-line
comments is a particularly powerful tool since feedback
can be left at the exact spot needed.

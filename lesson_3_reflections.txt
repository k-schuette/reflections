When would you want to use a remote repository rather than
keeping all your work local?
Remote repositories allow work from another computer,
whether by a collaborator or the by repository creator.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your
remote repository?
You would want to wait and pull changes manually if you were
working on a separate branch of the project. Also the
internet connection might be weak or unsecured, so it would
be better to wait.

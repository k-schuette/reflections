When would you want to use a remote repository rather than
keeping all your work local?
Remote repositories allow work from another computer,
whether by a collaborator or the by repository creator.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather
than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your
remote repository?
You would want to wait and pull changes manually if you were
working on a separate branch of the project. Also the
internet connection might be weak or unsecured, so it would
be better to wait.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?
Branch: Offshoot of master branch. Used to experiment with
new features that may or may not work and/or be
incorporated into the master branch.
Clone: Copy of a repository on a local host.
Fork: Special type of clone on GitHub. Changes to a fork
do not change the original repository, but GitHub
maintains a link that shows which account originally
created the repository.
